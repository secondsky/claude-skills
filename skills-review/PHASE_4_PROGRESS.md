# PHASE 4 PROGRESS - SMALLER SKILLS REVIEW
## Quick Review for Well-Sized Skills (44 skills, <800 lines each)

**Status**: ⬜ NOT STARTED (0 of 44 complete)
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Approach**: Light touch review, most may already be well-organized

---

## APPROACH FOR SMALLER SKILLS

Skills under 800 lines typically:
- Are already fairly concise
- May need minor reorganization
- Perhaps 1 reference file at most
- Quick review per skill (10-20 minutes)

**Time per skill**: 10-20 minutes average

---

## REVIEW CRITERIA

For each skill, ask:
1. Is SKILL.md already well-organized? (If yes, mark as "Good as is")
2. Are there any long code blocks (>50 lines)? → Extract to templates/
3. Are there repetitive patterns? → Extract to references/
4. Is the quick start clear and prominent?

**Most skills in this phase may need no changes.**
