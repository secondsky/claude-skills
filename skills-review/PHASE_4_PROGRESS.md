# PHASE 4 PROGRESS - SMALLER SKILLS REVIEW
## Quick Review for Well-Sized Skills (44 skills, <800 lines each)

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (25 of 47 complete - 53%)
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Approach**: Light touch review based on actual size, most small skills already well-organized

**Processing Strategy**:
- Tier 1 (<500 lines): 11 skills - Quick scan, likely "good as is" (15-30 min total)
- Tier 2 (500-800 lines): 12 skills - Light review, maybe 1 template (2-3 hours)
- Tier 3 (800-1500 lines): 13 skills - Phase 3 approach (6-8 hours)
- Tier 4 (>1500 lines): 8 skills - Phase 2 approach (4-6 hours)

---

## APPROACH FOR SMALLER SKILLS

Skills under 800 lines typically:
- Are already fairly concise
- May need minor reorganization
- Perhaps 1 reference file at most
- Quick review per skill (10-20 minutes)

**Time per skill**: 10-20 minutes average

---

## REVIEW CRITERIA

For each skill, ask:
1. Is SKILL.md already well-organized? (If yes, mark as "Good as is")
2. Are there any long code blocks (>50 lines)? → Extract to templates/
3. Are there repetitive patterns? → Extract to references/
4. Is the quick start clear and prominent?

**Most skills in this phase may need no changes.**
