  "description": "This skill should be used when building Vue or Nuxt applications with animated UI components and effects. Inspira UI provides 120+ production-ready components including backgrounds (aurora, cosmic portal, particles), buttons (shimmer, ripple, rainbow), cards (3D, flip, spotlight), text animations (morphing, glitch, hyper text), special effects (confetti, meteors, neon borders), cursors (fluid, tailed), visualizations (3D globe, carousels, icon cloud), input forms (color picker, file upload), device mocks (iPhone, Safari), and miscellaneous components (dock, timeline, bento grid). Built with TailwindCSS v4, motion-v, GSAP, and Three.js for Vue 3 and Nuxt 4 projects. This skill should be used when implementing animated hero sections, interactive backgrounds, modern UI effects, 3D visualizations, form inputs with effects, testimonial blocks, or any animated web interface components for Vue/Nuxt applications. Prevents common pitfalls with TailwindCSS v4 setup, CSS variables configuration, motion-v integration, component prop typing, and WebGL dependencies.\n",
