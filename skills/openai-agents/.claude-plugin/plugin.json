  "description": "Use this skill when building AI applications with OpenAI Agents SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript. The skill covers both text-based agents and realtime voice agents, including multi-agent workflows (handoffs), tools with Zod schemas, input/output guardrails, structured outputs, streaming, human-in-the-loop patterns, and framework integrations for Cloudflare Workers, Next.js, and React. It prevents 9+ common errors including Zod schema type errors, MCP tracing failures, infinite loops, tool call failures, and schema mismatches. The skill includes comprehensive templates for all agent types, error handling patterns, and debugging strategies.
