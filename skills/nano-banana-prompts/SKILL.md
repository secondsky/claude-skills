# Nano Banana Image Prompt Generator

Generate high-quality prompts for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image using proven best practices from October 2025.

## Core Principle

**Describe scenes naturally, don't list keywords.**

❌ `woman, business suit, office, professional`
✅ `A professional businesswoman in navy suit stands confidently in modern glass-walled office overlooking city skyline. Warm afternoon light streams through windows.`

## Prompt Structure

### Basic Template

```
A [SHOT TYPE] of [SUBJECT] [ACTION] in [ENVIRONMENT]. 
[LIGHTING] creates [MOOD]. [CAMERA/STYLE DETAILS]. [ASPECT RATIO].
```

### Components

1. **Subject & Action** - Who/what and what they're doing
2. **Setting** - Where the scene takes place
3. **Lighting** - Natural/artificial light sources and quality
4. **Mood** - Emotional tone or atmosphere
5. **Technical Details** - Camera, lens, style specifics
6. **Format** - Aspect ratio or dimensions

## Prompt Length

- **Short (10-20 words)**: Quick generation, minimal control
- **Medium (50-100 words)**: ⭐ RECOMMENDED - balanced control
- **Long (100-200 words)**: Maximum control for complex scenes

## Photography Prompts

### Template
```
Photorealistic [SHOT TYPE] of [SUBJECT], [ACTION], in [ENVIRONMENT]. 
Illuminated by [LIGHTING], creating [MOOD]. Captured with [CAMERA/LENS], 
emphasizing [DETAILS]. [ASPECT RATIO] format.
```

### Camera Control

**Lenses:**

- Motion blur for action

### Example
```
Professional corporate headshot of mid-30s woman with shoulder-length brown hair 
in charcoal blazer. She's smiling warmly at camera against soft gray backdrop. 
Shot with 85mm f/2.0, studio three-point lighting creates gentle shadows defining 
facial features. Ultra-high resolution, LinkedIn-ready quality. 1:1 format.
```

## Art & Illustration Prompts

### Template

emphasizing [QUALITIES].
```

### Common Styles

### Example
```
Watercolor illustration of young girl reading book under oak tree. Seated 
cross-legged in sun-dappled clearing with wildflowers. Soft, loose brushstrokes 
with pastel color palette of greens, yellows, pinks. Transparent washes create 
dreamy, ethereal quality. Inspired by children's book illustration, emphasizing 
wonder and tranquility. 4:5 portrait format.
```

## Text Rendering

**Best Practices:**
- Keep under 25 characters total
- Maximum 2-3 phrases
- Specify font style (bold, script, sans-serif)
- Put exact text in quotes
- Describe position explicitly

**Example:**
```
Movie poster with bold red text "SUMMER" at top and "Adventure Awaits" 
in white script font at bottom. Ocean sunset background. Cinematic style.
```

## Multi-Turn Editing Workflow

Nano Banana excels at conversational editing. Make one change at a time.

**Example sequence:**
1. "Create professional headshot of woman in business attire"
2. "Change background to modern office"
3. "Make her wearing glasses"
4. "Add warmer lighting"

## Product Photography

### Template
```

to [PURPOSE]. Camera angle: [TYPE] to showcase [FEATURE]. Ultra-realistic, 
sharp focus on [DETAIL]. [ASPECT RATIO].
```

### Example
```
High-resolution product photo of stainless steel smartwatch on white marble 
surface. Soft diffused studio lighting from 45-degree angle to minimize 
reflections and show screen clearly. Camera angle: slight overhead to showcase 
circular face and metal band texture. Ultra-realistic, sharp focus on watch
