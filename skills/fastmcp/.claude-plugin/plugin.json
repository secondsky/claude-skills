  "description": "Use this skill when building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers with FastMCP in Python. FastMCP is a framework for creating servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts to LLMs like Claude. The skill covers server creation, tool/resource definitions, storage backends (memory/disk/Redis/DynamoDB), server lifespans, middleware system (8 built-in types), server composition (import/mount), OAuth Proxy, authentication patterns, icons, OpenAPI integration, client configuration, cloud deployment (FastMCP Cloud), error handling, and production patterns. It prevents 25+ common errors including storage misconfiguration, lifespan issues, middleware order errors, circular imports, module-level server issues, async/await confusion, OAuth security vulnerabilities, and cloud deployment failures. Includes templates for basic servers, storage backends, middleware, server composition, OAuth proxy, API integrations, testing, and self-contained production architectures.\n",
