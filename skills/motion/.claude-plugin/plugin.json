  "description": "Production-ready setup for Motion (formerly Framer Motion) - the most popular React animation library with 30,200+ GitHub stars. Motion provides declarative animations, gesture controls, scroll-based effects, spring physics, layout animations, and SVG manipulation. This skill should be used when building UIs that need complex animations beyond simple list transitions: gesture controls (drag, hover, tap), scroll-linked animations, parallax effects, shared element transitions, SVG path morphing, spring physics, or orchestrated animation sequences. Use when: Adding drag-and-drop interactions, creating scroll-triggered animations, implementing modal dialogs with sophisticated transitions, building carousels with momentum, animating page/route transitions, creating hero sections with parallax, implementing accordion components with smooth expand/collapse, or optimizing animation bundle size with LazyMotion. **Important**: For simple list add/remove/sort animations, use the `auto-animate` skill instead (3.28 KB vs 34 KB bundle). Motion is designed for complex interactive animations that require fine-grained control.\n",
