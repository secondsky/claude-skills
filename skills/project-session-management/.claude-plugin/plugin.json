  "description": "Manages session state and context handoffs for multi-session projects using the Session Handoff Protocol. Creates and maintains SESSION.md to track phase progress, git checkpoints, and next actions across context clears. Integrates with project-planning skill to convert IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md into trackable session state. Use when starting new projects after planning, resuming work after context clear, or managing complex multi-phase implementations.",
