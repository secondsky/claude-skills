  "description": "Set up Google Gemini File Search for fully managed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This skill should be used when building document Q&A systems, searchable knowledge bases, or semantic search with automatic chunking, embedding generation, and citation support. Supports 100+ file formats including PDF, Word, Excel, code files. Prevents common errors: document immutability (delete+re-upload pattern required), storage quota calculation (3x input size for embeddings), chunking configuration (500 tokens/chunk recommended), metadata limits (20 key-value pairs max), indexing cost surprises (one-time $0.15/1M tokens), operation polling (must wait for done: true), force delete requirement (for stores with documents), and model support (only Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash). TypeScript/JavaScript support via @google/genai SDK. Token savings: ~65%.\n",
