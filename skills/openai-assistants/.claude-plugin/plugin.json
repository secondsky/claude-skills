  "description": "Complete guide for OpenAI's Assistants API v2: stateful conversational AI with built-in tools (Code Interpreter, File Search, Function Calling), vector stores for RAG (up to 10,000 files), thread/run lifecycle management, and streaming patterns. Both Node.js SDK and fetch approaches. ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE: OpenAI plans to sunset Assistants API in H1 2026 in favor of Responses API. This skill remains valuable for existing apps and migration planning. Use when: building stateful chatbots with OpenAI, implementing RAG with vector stores, executing Python code with Code Interpreter, using file search for document Q&A, managing conversation threads, streaming assistant responses, or encountering errors like \"thread already has active run\", vector store indexing delays, run polling timeouts, or file upload issues.
