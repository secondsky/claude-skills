  "description": "Automate complete feature development lifecycle with 7-phase guided workflow including codebase exploration, architecture design, and quality review. Use when building complex features, making architectural decisions, integrating with existing code, or clarifying ambiguous requirements. Launches specialized agents (code-explorer, code-architect, code-reviewer) that run in parallel for discovery, design, and review phases. Prevents common mistakes by ensuring understanding before implementation, asking clarifying questions, comparing design approaches, and reviewing for bugs and conventions. Use when: building multi-file features, requiring architectural decisions, integrating with existing patterns, or working with underspecified requirements. Don't use for: single-line fixes, trivial changes, or urgent hotfixes.\n",
