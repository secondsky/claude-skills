  Comprehensive deep-dive documentation review process for claude-skills repository. Use this skill when investigating suspected issues in a skill, major package version updates detected (e.g., better-auth 1.x → 2.x), skill last verified >3 months ago, before marketplace submission, or when examples seem outdated. Performs systematic 9-phase audit: pre-review setup, standards compliance, official docs verification (Context7/WebFetch), code examples audit, cross-file consistency, dependency version checks, issue categorization by severity, fix implementation with minimal user questions, and post-fix verification. Prevents outdated documentation, incorrect API patterns, contradictory examples, version drift, broken links, YAML errors, schema inconsistencies, and missing dependencies. Combines automated technical checks (YAML syntax, package versions via npm, link validation, TODO markers) with AI-powered verification. Auto-fixes unambiguous issues, asks user only for architectural decisions or breaking change confirmations. Outputs severity-classified issue list (🔴 Critical / 🟡 High / 🟠 Medium / 🟢 Low) with evidence citations (GitHub URLs, official docs, npm changelogs) and detailed remediation plan. Production-tested on better-auth v2.0.0 audit (found 6 critical/high issues, removed 665 lines of incorrect code, added 1,931 lines of correct patterns).

# Skill Review Skill

## Overview

The skill-review skill provides a comprehensive, systematic process for auditing skills in the claude-skills repository. It combines automated technical validation with AI-powered verification to ensure skills remain accurate, current, and high-quality.

**Use this skill when**:
- Investigating suspected issues in a skill
- Major package version updates released (e.g., better-auth 1.x → 2.x)
- Skill last verified >90 days ago
- Before submitting skill to marketplace
- User reports errors following skill instructions
- Examples seem outdated or contradictory

**Production evidence**: Successfully audited better-auth skill (2025-11-08), found 6 critical/high issues including non-existent API imports, removed 665 lines of incorrect code, implemented v2.0.0 with correct patterns.

---

## Quick Start

### Invoke via Slash Command

```
/review-skill <skill-name>
```

**Example**:
```
/review-skill better-auth
```

### Invoke via Skill (Proactive)

When Claude notices potential issues, it can suggest:
```
User: "I'm having trouble with better-auth and D1"

Claude: "I notice the better-auth skill was last verified 6 months ago.
Would you like me to review it? Better-auth recently released v1.3
with D1 changes."
```

---

## What This Skill Does

### 9-Phase Systematic Audit

1. **Pre-Review Setup** (5-10 min)
   - Install skill locally: `./scripts/install-skill.sh <skill-name>`
   - Check current version and last verified date
   - Test skill discovery

2. **Standards Compliance** (10-15 min)
   - Validate YAML frontmatter (name, description, license)
   - Check keyword comprehensiveness
   - Verify third-person description style
   - Ensure directory structure matches spec

3. **Official Documentation Verification** (15-30 min)
   - Use Context7 MCP or WebFetch to verify API patterns
   - Check GitHub for recent updates and issues
   - Verify package versions against npm registry
   - Compare with production repositories

4. **Code Examples & Templates Audit** (20-40 min)
   - Verify import statements exist in current packages
   - Check API method signatures match official docs
   - Ensure schema consistency across files
   - Test templates build and run

5. **Cross-File Consistency** (15-25 min)
   - Compare SKILL.md vs README.md examples
   - Verify "Bundled Resources" section matches actual files
   - Ensure configuration examples consistent

6. **Dependencies & Versions** (10-15 min)
   - Run `./scripts/check-versions.sh <skill-name>`
   - Check for breaking changes in package updates
   - Verify "Last Verified" date is recent

7. **Issue Categorization** (10-20 min)
   - Classify by severity: 🔴 Critical / 🟡 High / 🟠 Medium / 🟢 Low
   - Document with evidence (GitHub URL, docs link, npm changelog)

8. **Fix Implementation** (30 min - 4 hours)
   - Auto-fix unambiguous issues
   - Ask user only for architectural decisions
   - Update all affected files consistently
   - Bump version if breaking changes

9. **Post-Fix Verification** (10-15 min)
   - Test skill discovery
   - Verify templates work
   - Check no contradictions remain
   - Commit with detailed changelog

### Automated Checks (via script)

The skill runs `./scripts/review-skill.sh <skill-name>` which checks:
- ✅ YAML frontmatter syntax and required fields
- ✅ Package version currency (npm)
- ✅ Broken links (HTTP status)
- ✅ TODO markers in code
- ✅ File organization (expected directories exist)
- ✅ "Last Verified" date staleness

### Manual Verification (AI-powered)

Claude performs:
- 🔍 API method verification against official docs
- 🔍 GitHub activity and issue checks
- 🔍 Production repository comparisons
- 🔍 Code example correctness
- 🔍 Schema consistency validation

---

## Process Workflow

### Step 1: Run Automated Checks

```bash
./scripts/review-skill.sh <skill-name>
```

Interpret output to identify technical issues.

### Step 2: Execute Manual Verification

For **Phase 3: Official Documentation Verification**:

1. Use Context7 MCP (if available):
   ```
   Use Context7 to fetch: /websites/<package-docs>
   Search for: [API method from skill]
   ```

2. Or use WebFetch:
   ```
   Fetch: https://<official-docs-url>
   Verify: [specific patterns]
   ```

3. Check GitHub:
   ```
   Visit: https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/commits/main
   Check: Last commit, recent changes
   Search issues: [keywords from skill]
   ```

4. Find production examples:
   ```
   WebSearch: "<package> cloudflare production github"
   Compare: Do real projects match our patterns?
   ```

For **Phase 4: Code Examples Audit**:

- Verify all imports exist (check official docs)
- Check API method signatures match
- Ensure schema consistency across files
- Test templates actually work

### Step 3: Categorize Issues

**🔴 CRITICAL** - Breaks functionality:
- Non-existent API methods/imports
- Invalid configuration
- Missing required dependencies

**🟡 HIGH** - Causes confusion:
- Contradictory examples across files
- Inconsistent patterns
- Outdated major versions

**🟠 MEDIUM** - Reduces quality:
- Stale minor versions (>90 days)
- Missing documentation sections
- Incomplete error lists

**🟢 LOW** - Polish issues:
- Typos, formatting inconsistencies
- Missing optional metadata

### Step 4: Fix Issues

**Auto-fix** when:
- ✅ Fix is unambiguous (correct import from docs)
- ✅ Evidence is clear
- ✅ No architectural impact

**Ask user** when:
- ❓ Multiple valid approaches
- ❓ Breaking change decision
- ❓ Architectural choice

**Format for questions**:
```
I found [issue]. There are [N] approaches:

1. [Approach A] - [Pros/Cons]
2. [Approach B] - [Pros/Cons]

Recommendation: [Default based on evidence]

Which would you prefer?
```

### Step 5: Version Bump Assessment

If breaking changes:
- Major: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0 (API patterns change)
- Minor: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 (new features, backward compatible)
- Patch: v1.0.0 → v1.0.1 (bug fixes only)

### Step 6: Generate Audit Report

```markdown
## Skill Review Report: <skill-name>

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Trigger**: [Why review performed]
**Time Spent**: [Duration]

### Findings

🔴 CRITICAL (N): [List with evidence]
🟡 HIGH (N): [List with evidence]
🟠 MEDIUM (N): [List with evidence]
🟢 LOW (N): [List with evidence]

### Remediation

**Files Modified**: [List]
**Version Update**: [old] → [new]
**Breaking Changes**: Yes/No

### Verification

✅ Discovery test passed
✅ Templates work
✅ Committed: [hash]

### Recommendation

[Final assessment]
```

## Example: better-auth Audit

### Findings

**Issue #1: Non-existent d1Adapter** 🔴 CRITICAL

*Location*: `references/cloudflare-worker-example.ts:17`

*Problem*: Imports `d1Adapter` from `'better-auth/adapters/d1'` which doesn't exist

*Evidence*:
- Official docs: https://better-auth.com/docs/integrations/drizzle
- GitHub: No `d1Adapter` export in codebase
- Production: 4 repos use Drizzle/Kysely

*Fix*: Replace with `drizzleAdapter` from `'better-auth/adapters/drizzle'`

### Result

- **Files deleted**: 3 (obsolete patterns)
- **Files created**: 3 (correct patterns)
- **Lines changed**: +1,266 net
- **Version**: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0
- **Time**: 3.5 hours
