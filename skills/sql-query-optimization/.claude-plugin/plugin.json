  "description": "Comprehensive SQL query performance optimization for PostgreSQL and MySQL using indexing strategies, query plan analysis, and systematic optimization workflows. This skill provides patterns for debugging slow queries, creating optimal indexes, rewriting inefficient queries, and monitoring database performance. Use when: debugging slow database queries, analyzing EXPLAIN output, optimizing query execution plans, creating indexes for performance, rewriting N+1 queries, implementing pagination, using prepared statements, monitoring query performance, or encountering \"sequential scan\", \"missing index\", \"N+1 query problem\", \"slow LIKE queries\", \"OFFSET pagination\", \"temp table spills\", or cache hit ratio issues. Prevents 12 documented issues: sequential scans on large tables, missing indexes on foreign keys, N+1 query problems from ORMs, leading wildcard LIKE queries, SELECT * in production, missing LIMIT on large results, inefficient subqueries vs JOINs, stale statistics after bulk loads, missing composite indexes, wrong index column order, SQL injection from non-parameterized queries, and missing connection pooling. Keywords: sql optimization, query performance, database indexes, explain analyze, slow queries, n+1 problem, query plan, index strategy, composite index, covering index, postgresql performance, mysql optimization, query rewriting, prepared statements, connection pooling, sequential scan, missing index, SELECT *, LIMIT optimization, subquery performance, pagination, cursor based pagination, batch operations, pg_stat_statements, full-text search, bitmap scan, index only scan, query tuning, database performance, cache hit ratio, work_mem, shared_buffers, database monitoring\n",
