  "description": "Comprehensive database sharding implementation patterns for PostgreSQL and MySQL. Covers hash-based, range-based, and directory-based sharding strategies, shard key selection, cross-shard queries, rebalancing, and router implementation. Use when scaling beyond single-server capacity, implementing multi-tenant isolation, distributing geographic load, or handling billions of records. Essential for high-traffic applications requiring horizontal scalability. Prevents 10 documented issues: wrong shard key choice (hotspots), missing shard key in queries, cross-shard transactions without handling, hotspot shards from sequential IDs, no rebalancing strategy, timestamp-based sharding hotspots, mutable shard keys, missing shard routing layer, no monitoring for shard balance, incorrect hash function. Production-tested with routers, aggregation patterns, and zero-downtime migration strategies.\n",
