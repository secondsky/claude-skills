## Core Concepts

### Topic Clusters

A topic cluster consists of:
- **Pillar page**: Comprehensive guide on broad topic (2000-4000 words)
- **Cluster content**: Detailed articles on specific subtopics (800-1500 words each)
- **Internal links**: Bidirectional links connecting all related content

```text
                    [Pillar Page]
                  "Project Management"
                          |
        +----------------+----------------+
        |                |                |
   [Cluster 1]      [Cluster 2]     [Cluster 3]
   "PM Tools"       "PM Methods"    "PM Skills"
        |                |                |
    +--+--+          +--+--+          +--+--+
    |     |          |     |          |     |
  Sub1  Sub2      Sub1  Sub2       Sub1  Sub2
```

### Keyword Clustering Strategy

Group keywords by:
1. **Search intent**: Informational, commercial, transactional
2. **Topic similarity**: Semantic relationships
3. **User journey stage**: Awareness, consideration, decision
4. **Content type**: How-to, comparison, definition, list

## Clustering Process

### Step 1: Analyze Keywords

```markdown
Example keyword list:
- project management software (2.4k vol)
- best project management tools (1.8k vol)
- project management apps (1.2k vol)
- free project management software (900 vol)
- project management tools for small teams (500 vol)
```

### Step 2: Identify Clusters

Group by semantic similarity:

#### Cluster 1: Software Selection
- project management software
- best project management tools
- project management apps
- top pm software

#### Cluster 2: Budget/Pricing
- free project management software
- project management software pricing
- affordable pm tools
- pm software cost

#### Cluster 3: Team Size
- pm tools for small teams
- enterprise project management
- pm for startups
- pm for large organizations

### Step 3: Create Architecture

```markdown
Pillar Page: "Complete Guide to Project Management Software"
├── Cluster 1: Software Selection
│   ├── Best Project Management Tools 2024
│   ├── Project Management Apps Comparison
│   └── Top PM Software Features
├── Cluster 2: Budget & Pricing
│   ├── Free Project Management Software Options

## Keyword Research Integration

### Organize by Intent

**Informational Intent**:
- "what is [topic]"
- "how to [action]"
- "[topic] guide"
- "[topic] examples"

**Commercial Intent**:
- "best [product]"
- "[product] comparison"
- "[product] review"
- "top [product] for [use case]"

**Transactional Intent**:
- "[product] pricing"
- "buy [product]"
- "[product] discount"
- "[product] free trial"

### Search Volume Tiers

```markdown
High Volume (>1000/month):
- Primary pillar page targets
- High priority for content creation
- Competitive but high reward

Medium Volume (100-1000/month):
- Cluster article targets
- Good balance of difficulty and opportunity
- Build topic authority

Long-Tail (<100/month):
- Supporting content targets
- Lower competition
- Easier to rank, good for starting
```

## Internal Linking Guidelines

### Anchor Text Best Practices

**Good Examples**:
- "project management best practices"
- "how to implement agile methodology"
- "comparison of top CRM platforms"

**Bad Examples**:
- "click here" ❌ (not descriptive)
- "this article" ❌ (no keyword context)
- "project management project management" ❌ (stuffing)

### Link Structure

**Hub-and-Spoke Model**:
```text
Every cluster article links:
→ To pillar page (1 link)
→ To 2-3 related cluster articles (lateral links)
← From pillar page (receives link)
```

**Link Frequency**:
- Pillar to cluster: 1-2 contextual links
- Cluster to pillar: 1 link (introduction or conclusion)
- Cluster to cluster: 2-3 related links

## Content Calendar Template

```markdown
| Month | Week | Content Type | Title | Target Keyword | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|----------------|--------|
| Jan | 1 | Pillar | [Title] | [keyword] | Planning |
| Jan | 2 | Cluster | [Title] | [keyword] | In Progress |
| Jan | 3 | Cluster | [Title] | [keyword] | Not Started |
| Jan | 4 | Cluster | [Title] | [keyword] | Not Started |
| Feb | 1 | Cluster | [Title] | [keyword] | Not Started |
```
