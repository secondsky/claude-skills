  "description": "Use this skill when building AI voice agents with the ElevenLabs Agents Platform. This skill covers the complete platform including agent configuration (system prompts, turn-taking, workflows), voice & language features (multi-voice, pronunciation, speed control), knowledge base (RAG), tools (client/server/MCP/system), SDKs (React, JavaScript, React Native, Swift, Widget), Scribe (real-time STT), WebRTC/WebSocket connections, testing & evaluation, analytics, privacy/compliance (GDPR/HIPAA/SOC 2), cost optimization, CLI workflows (\"agents as code\"), and DevOps integration. Prevents 17+ common errors including package deprecation, Android audio cutoff, CSP violations, missing dynamic variables, case-sensitive tool names, webhook authentication failures, and WebRTC configuration issues. Provides production-tested templates for React, Next.js, React Native, Swift, and Cloudflare Workers. Token savings: ~73% (22k → 6k tokens). Production tested.\n",
