  "description": "Use this skill when contributing code to open source projects. The skill covers proper pull request creation, avoiding common mistakes that annoy maintainers, cleaning up personal development artifacts before submission, writing effective PR descriptions, following project conventions, and communicating professionally with maintainers. It prevents 16 common contribution mistakes including working on main branch, not testing before PR submission, including unrelated changes, submitting planning documents, session notes, temporary test files, screenshots, and other personal artifacts. Includes 3 Critical Workflow Rules that must NEVER be skipped: (1) Always work on feature branches, (2) Test thoroughly with evidence before PR, (3) Keep PRs focused on single feature. The skill includes automation scripts to validate PRs before submission, templates for PR descriptions and commit messages, and comprehensive checklists. This skill should be used whenever creating pull requests for public repositories, contributing to community projects, or submitting code to projects you don't own.\n",
