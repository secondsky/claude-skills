  "description": "Production-ready authentication framework for TypeScript with Cloudflare D1 support via Drizzle ORM or Kysely. Use this skill when building auth systems as a self-hosted alternative to Clerk or Auth.js, particularly for Cloudflare Workers projects. CRITICAL: better-auth requires Drizzle ORM or Kysely as database adapters - there is NO direct D1 adapter. Supports social providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple), email/password, magic links, 2FA, passkeys, organizations, and RBAC. Prevents 12+ common authentication errors including D1 adapter misconfiguration, schema generation issues, session serialization, CORS, OAuth flows, and JWT token handling.
