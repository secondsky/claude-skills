  "description": "This skill provides comprehensive knowledge for building type-safe, validated forms in React using React Hook Form and Zod schema validation. Use when: building forms with validation in React, integrating Zod schema validation with React Hook Form, using shadcn/ui Form or Field components, implementing client and server-side validation with a single schema, handling complex validation scenarios (nested objects, arrays, conditional fields, async validation), building multi-step forms or wizards, implementing dynamic form fields with useFieldArray, optimizing form performance and re-renders, ensuring accessible form error handling, or debugging form validation issues.\n",
