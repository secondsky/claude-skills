  "description": "This skill provides comprehensive knowledge for integrating Clerk authentication in React, Next.js, and Cloudflare Workers applications. It should be used when setting up user authentication, implementing protected routes, verifying JWT tokens, creating custom JWT templates with user metadata and organization claims, configuring Clerk middleware, integrating with shadcn/ui components, testing authentication flows, or troubleshooting Clerk authentication errors. Use when: adding Clerk to React/Vite projects, setting up Clerk in Next.js App Router, implementing Clerk authentication in Cloudflare Workers, configuring clerkMiddleware for route protection, creating custom JWT templates with shortcodes (user.id, user.email, user.public_metadata.role), accessing session claims for RBAC, integrating with Supabase/Grafbase, verifying tokens with @clerk/backend, integrating Clerk with Hono, using Clerk shadcn/ui components, writing E2E tests with Playwright, generating test session tokens, using test email addresses and phone numbers, or encountering authentication errors. Prevents 11 documented issues: missing secret key errors, API key migration failures, JWKS cache race conditions, CSRF vulnerabilities from missing authorizedParties, import path errors after Core 2 upgrade, JWT size limit issues, deprecated API version warnings, ClerkProvider JSX component errors, async auth() helper confusion, environment variable misconfiguration, and Vite dev mode 431 header errors.
