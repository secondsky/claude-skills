  "description": "Production-tested setup for Base UI (@base-ui-components/react) - MUI's unstyled component library that provides accessible, customizable React components using render props pattern. This skill should be used when building accessible UIs with full styling control, migrating from Radix UI, or needing components with Floating UI integration for smart positioning. Use when: Setting up Base UI in Vite + React projects, migrating from Radix UI to Base UI, implementing accessible components (Dialog, Select, Popover, Tooltip, NumberField, Accordion), encountering positioning issues with popups, needing render prop API instead of asChild pattern, building with Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui, or deploying to Cloudflare Workers. ⚠️ BETA STATUS: Base UI is v1.0.0-beta.4. Stable v1.0 expected Q4 2025. This skill provides workarounds for known beta issues and guidance on API stability.
