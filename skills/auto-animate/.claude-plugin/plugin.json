  "description": "Production-tested setup for AutoAnimate (@formkit/auto-animate) - a zero-config, drop-in animation library that automatically adds smooth transitions when DOM elements are added, removed, or moved. This skill should be used when building UIs that need simple, automatic animations for lists, accordions, toasts, or form validation messages without the complexity of full animation libraries. Use when: Adding smooth animations to dynamic lists, building filter/sort interfaces, creating accordion components, implementing toast notifications, animating form validation messages, needing simple transitions without animation code, working with Vite + React + Tailwind, deploying to Cloudflare Workers Static Assets, or encountering SSR errors with animation libraries.\n",
