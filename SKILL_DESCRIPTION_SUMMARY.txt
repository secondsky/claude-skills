EXAMPLE FIXES
================================================================================

WEAK OPENING (cloudflare-d1):
  Current:  "Complete knowledge domain for Cloudflare D1 - serverless SQLite
             database on Cloudflare's edge network."
  Fixed:    "Configure and query Cloudflare D1 serverless SQLite databases
             from Workers with comprehensive knowledge of migrations, bindings,
             query optimization, and relational schema design."

WEAK OPENING (openai-api):
  Current:  "Complete guide for OpenAI's traditional/stateless APIs: Chat
             Completions (GPT-5, GPT-4o), Embeddings, Batch API, and Vision."
  Fixed:    "Integrate OpenAI's Chat Completions, Embeddings, Vision, and
             Batch APIs for server-side AI features including streaming
             responses, function calling, and multi-modal content processing."

SECOND PERSON (better-chatbot-patterns):
  Current:  "...in your own projects (not contributing to better-chatbot
             itself)."
  Fixed:    "...in custom codebases (not for contributing to better-chatbot
             itself)."
