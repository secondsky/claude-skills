# Sequential Thinking Skill

Structured problem-solving through iterative reasoning with revision and branching capabilities.

## Overview

This skill enables Claude to break complex problems into sequential thought steps, dynamically adjust scope, revise previous conclusions, and explore alternative reasoning paths.

## Core Capabilities

- **Iterative reasoning**: Break complex problems into sequential steps
- **Dynamic scope**: Adjust total thought count as understanding evolves
- **Revision tracking**: Reconsider and modify previous conclusions
- **Branch exploration**: Explore alternative reasoning paths
- **Maintained context**: Keep track of reasoning chain

## When to Use

- Problem requires multiple interconnected reasoning steps
- Initial scope or approach is uncertain
- Need to filter through complexity to find core issues
- May need to backtrack or revise earlier conclusions
- Want to explore alternative solution paths

**Don't use for**: Simple queries, direct facts, or single-step tasks.
