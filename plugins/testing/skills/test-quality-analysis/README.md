# Test Quality Analysis Skill

Detect test smells, overmocking, flaky tests, and coverage issues.

## Overview

Expert guidance for analyzing and improving test quality by identifying anti-patterns, weak assertions, and maintainability issues.

## When to Use

- Reviewing test code quality
- Detecting test smells (overmocking, flaky tests)
- Improving test maintainability
- Analyzing test effectiveness
- Code review for test suites

## Key Detections

- **Overmocking**: Too many mocks disconnecting tests from reality
- **Fragile Tests**: Tests that break with unrelated changes
- **Flaky Tests**: Non-deterministic test results
- **Poor Assertions**: Weak or missing verification
- **Insufficient Coverage**: Missing critical paths

## Best Practices Covered

- FIRST principles (Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely)
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock usage guidelines
- Coverage goals (80%+)
- Test naming conventions

## Auto-Trigger Keywords

- test smells
- test quality
- overmocking
- flaky tests
- test coverage analysis
- test maintainability
- test anti-patterns
