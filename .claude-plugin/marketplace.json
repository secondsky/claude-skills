Use when: adding Clerk to React/Vite projects, setting up Clerk in Next.js App Router, implementing Clerk authentication in Cloudflare Workers, configuring clerkMiddleware for route protection, creating custom JWT templates with shortcodes (user.id, user.email, user.public_metadata.role), accessing session claims for RBAC, integrating with Supabase/Grafbase, verifying tokens with @clerk/backend, integrating Clerk with Hono, using Clerk shadcn/ui components, writing E2E tests with Playwright, generating test session tokens, using test email addresses and phone numbers, or encountering authentication errors. Prevents 11 documented issues: missing secret key errors, API key migration failures, JWKS cache race conditions, CSRF vulnerabilities from missing authorizedParties, import path errors after Core 2 upgrade, JWT size limit issues, deprecated API version warnings, ClerkProvider JSX component errors, async auth() helper confusion, environment variable misconfiguration, and Vite dev mode 431 header errors.",
